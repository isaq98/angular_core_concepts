# angular_core_concepts
This is my first time working with Angular and TypeScript, so I wanted to build a small project in order to familiarize with core concepts.
This project takes hardcoded data to simulate online shopping orders. It provides functionality such as sorting alphabetically by name, location, or by total cost.
In addition, it allows the user to search for results based on price, name, or location too.

## Usage
As mentioned, this is an Angular application. There are two ways to launch it.

** Install Angular CLI **
Installing the Angular CLI can be done on the Command Line like so:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
Once installed, you can run the application using either of the following two commands:
```
ng serve -o --poll=2000
```
Or
```
npm start
```

Then the program should be launched on a localhost server for you to interact with.

##Contributions
Much of my code was able to created thanks to this [Introductory Angular Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/yourfirstangularapp). It is a very helpful resource
for those looking to learn.
